# wisski_pb_visualization_prototyp
Testing different js netzwork libraries in drupal 8 system to visualize
WissKI pathbuilder templates (xml-files) and  developing a first prototype with cytoscape.js 

The project started as a bachelor thesis and contains two folders:

directory test_visualisations contains first approaches to evaluate different js libraries
to visualize a complex network (directed graph, so called pathbuilder templates based on xml structure) 
in WissKI system based on drupal 8.

directory wisski_pb_vis contains the drupal modul prototyp with cytoscape.js, 
which is the chosen library based on performance and functionality.
